# Shopping Cart

A TDD practice exercise suggested by Jason Gorman in his book on the subject - Codemanship - TDD.

## Instructions

Test-drive some code that will calculate the total net value of items in a shopping cart represented as a list of unit price and quantity - e.g. {{10.0, 5}, {25.5, 2}}, with the following discounts applied:

1. If total gross value > £100, apply a 5% discount
2. If total gross value > £200, apply a 10% discount

~~_Don't apply 5% discount if total gross value is equal to £100_~~

~~_Apply 10% discount if total gross value is over £200_~~

~~_Apply 5% discount (not 10%) if total gross value is equal to £200_~~

~~_Get '£0.00' as gross value if cart is empty_~~

~~_Get '£0.00' as net value if cart is empty_~~

## Expanding on above requirements
